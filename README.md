2014 Flask Study
================

* Facebook Group: <https://www.facebook.com/groups/2014flaskstudy/>


This repository includes my personal practice for the *2014 Flask Study*, in the facebook group named [Flask Korea][]. I have already used Flask heavily both for personal use and for work, but my usage has been limited to implementing API backends during the last few years. So I'll try to remember how web applications work and how to build them during this study.
