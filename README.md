================

* Facebook Group: <https://www.facebook.com/groups/2014flaskstudy/>


This is my personal practices during *2014 Flask Study*, in the facebook group named [Flask Korea][]. I have already used Flask heavily both in personal and in production, but my usage was limited at implementing API backends during last few years. So I'll try to remind how web applications work and how to build it during this study.
